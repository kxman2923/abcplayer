\section{Goals}
Our goal for this project is to write a program that takes an ABC file as input,
and plays it out loud. We also want to gain more experience with programming and with working on a team.

\section{Meeting Norms}
We will use the scheduled lecture/recitation time to meet and discuss the design in-person.
Unless there are major design or API problems that need to be addressed in-person,
we do not intend to meet very much outside of class,
and we will instead mostly communicate through e-mail and chat.
We will type the minutes of our in-person meetings and e-mail them to eachother.

\section{Work Norms}
We intend to split the design into three major parts:
the lexer, parser, and player.
Diony will write the lexer implementation,
Kharis will write the parser implementation,
and Chau will write the player implementation.
Each person will also write test cases for the implementations that they have not written. For example, Diony will also write parser and player tests.
Each person will also peer review the other team member's code.


If a team member does not fullfill their obligations, they will be contacted by email.
If they cannot be reached or do not comply, the other members will contact a TA for further assistance.

\section{Decision Making}
We will require consensus before any design decision is made.
